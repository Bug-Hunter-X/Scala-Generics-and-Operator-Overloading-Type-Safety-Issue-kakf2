This example demonstrates a subtle type safety issue in Scala that can occur when combining generics and operator overloading. The `MyClass` uses generics to allow the use of different types, and the `myMethod` utilizes the `+` operator.  The problem arises when using incompatible types; the compiler won't catch this issue, leading to a runtime exception. The solution demonstrates how to use type classes to enforce type safety.
